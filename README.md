# discord-lookup-api

## EOL Update (15/10/25)
Discord has apparently gone on a application ban wave for anyone that used the API.
If you have been affected by this, you can try to appeal it with Discord, even though it might not be accepted

The project has been left on hold for several months now because of personal issues, and with this now happening, I can't continue to host/contribute to it.

IF you still wish to use this API, do it at your own risk, and no support of anykind will be provided.

thanks for the support, and I'm deeply sorry for any inconvenience that might've occured
